# Nutrition-Analysis-

The Food analysis dataset contains 8619 total observations and 45 total columns with only 7 of them being categorical data such as the product ID, name, manufacturerâ€™s name, etc. and the rest of the columns being the numerical nutritional data. 

Performed various multivariate analysis techniques to answer the below problem statements.

1)	Using the right variables to plot items will give more insights on the nutrition on the food groups.
2)	Check for relevance, partial correlations between different nutrients on the food groups.
3)	Dimension-reduction method can be performed to derive dietary patterns from principal component analysis
4)	Factor analysis can be performed, and this result can be compared with the PCA results.
5)	Cluster analysis can be done on food groups to identify the similar dietary patterns.

Techniques used to solve the above problem statements:
1) PCA
2) MDA
3) Exploratory Factor Analysis
4) Clustering
